The program contains Naive-Bayes and SVC evaluations of the included data. SVC always gave a substantial amount of zeroes, no matter how it was tweaked. Attempted normalization; it did not work, and instead returned errors. As such, did without. No matter what, NB got better accuracy due to how it manipulates the data.

No video as it was demonstrated in-class.
